Hi! I’m a Data Scientist and AI Engineer with a deep passion for harnessing the power of data and artificial
intelligence to solve complex challenges. Currently, I’m part of the talented "_Innovation Research_" team
at [Elmec Informatica](https://www.elmec.com/), where I collaborate on innovative projects that drive data-driven
insights and AI-powered solutions.

With a strong foundation in data analysis, machine learning and AI, I’m always exploring new ways to apply advanced
techniques to improve business outcomes and enhance decision-making processes.
